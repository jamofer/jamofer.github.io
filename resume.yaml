    I am Javier Moragón, a software engineer with more than 5 years of professional
    experience that have worked mostly for mobile telecommunications systems.

    During my career I used a lot of programming languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, 
    PHP... but I am more proficient with Python, C, C++ and Kotlin. I'm used to work
    doing pair programming and I love to do outside-in TDD.

    I do not believe in knowledge silos and I think communication (not only with developers)
    it's one of the most important things in order to success as a software engineer.

    In the projects section you can see some stuff I have been working on.
