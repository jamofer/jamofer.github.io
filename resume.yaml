  description: >
    I am Javier Moragón, a software engineer with over 10 years of professional experience, primarily in mobile
    telecommunications systems.

    Throughout my career, I have worked with a wide range of programming languages, including Java, C#,
    JavaScript, and PHP. However, I am most proficient in Python, C, C++, and Kotlin. I have extensive
    experience with pair programming, outside-in TDD, and clean code practices to ensure maintainable
    and easy-to-understand code.

    I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and effective communication across the entire product team, not just
    among developers, as a key factor for success in software engineering.
