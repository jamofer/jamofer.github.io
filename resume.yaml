    I am Javier Moragón, a software engineer with more than 5 years of professional experience, mostly on mobile 
    telecommunications systems.

    During my career I used a lot of programming languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, 
    PHP... but I am more proficient with Python, C, C++ and Kotlin. I'm used to
    do pair programming and I love doing outside-in TDD.

    I do not believe in knowledge silos and I think communication (not only between developers)
    it's one of the most important things in order to succeed as a software engineer.
